Coldplay - Hymn for the weekend
You said, Drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Pour on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony

Ah, oh ah, oh ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high (so high), so high (so high)
Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high (so high), so high (so high)
(Woo)
(Ooh)
